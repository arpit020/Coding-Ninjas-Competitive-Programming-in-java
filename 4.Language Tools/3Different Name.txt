In Little Flowers Public School, there are many students with same first names. You are given a task to find the students with same names. You will be given a string comprising of all the names of students and you have to tell the name and count of those students having same. If all the names are unique, print -1 instead.
Note: We don't have to mention names whose frequency is 1.
Input Format:
The only line of input will have a string ‘str’ with space separated first names of students.
Output Format:
Print the names of students along with their count if they are repeating. If no name is repeating, print -1

        String str=sc.nextLine();
        String[] arr=str.split(" ");
        Map<String,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        for(String x:arr){
            int num=1;
            if(map.get(x)!=null){
                num=map.get(x)+1;
            }
            map.put(x,num);
        }
        boolean xx1=true;
        for(Map.Entry<String,Integer> xx:map.entrySet()){
            int v1=xx.getValue();
            if(v1>1){
                xx1=false;
                System.out.println(xx.getKey()+" "+v1);
            }
        }
        if(xx1){
            System.out.println(-1);
