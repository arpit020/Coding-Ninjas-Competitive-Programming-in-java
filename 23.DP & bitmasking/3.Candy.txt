Send Feedback
Gary is a teacher at XYZ school. To reward his N students he bought a packet of N candies all with different flavours. But the problem is some students like certain flavour while some doesn't. Now Gary wants to know the number of ways he can distribute these N candies to his N students such that every student gets exactly one candy he likes.
Input Format :
Line 1 : An integer N (1<= N <= 16) denoting number of students and candies.
Next N lines : N integers describing the preferences of one student. 1 at i'th (0 <= i < N) position denotes that this student likes i'th candy , 0 means he doesn't.
Assume input to be 0-indexed based.
Output Format :
Return the number of ways Gary can distribute these N candies to his N students such that every student gets exactly one candy he likes.``

                if(cost[student][i]==1){
                  ans+=candy(cost,student+1,mask|(1<<i),n,dp);
                }
