Solution:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        int arr[]=new int[b];
        int a1=a-1;
        
        for(int i=b-1;i>=1;i--){
            if(a1>=9){
                arr[i]=9;
                a1-=9;
            }else{
                arr[i]=a1;
                a1=0;
            }
        }
        arr[0]=a1+1;
        for(int i:arr){
            System.out.print(i);
        }
    }
